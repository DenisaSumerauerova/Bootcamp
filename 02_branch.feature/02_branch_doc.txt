Hawaii (Hawaiian: Hawaiâ€˜i) is a group of volcanic islands in the central Pacific Ocean.
The islands lie 2,397 miles from San Francisco, California, to the east and 5,293 miles from Manila, in the Philippines, to the west.
The capital is Honolulu, located on the island of Oahu. 

In the 19th century, the Hawaiian Islands saw population expansion and the establishment of a plantation system for growing sugar cane, coffee and pineapples.
The United States annexed the territory in 1898.
On the morning of December 7, 1941, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor near Honolulu, propelling the United States into World War II.
Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state on August 21, 1959.
